Made (and utilized) my own XCode template for this project. 
The NYUCodeBase XCode template simply wasn't working for me.
I think it was an XCode 6.0.1 thing. Or maybe I'm just dumb.
(For future reference, the executable/App would appear 
but the content would be a mess, rather than a neat black screen)
